# Example 3: Memory Chains

## What you'll learn:
- Adding conversation memory to maintain context across interactions
- Understanding different types of memory components in LangChain
- Building multi-turn conversations with context awareness
- Creating more sophisticated customer service experiences

## Concepts covered:
- **ConversationBufferMemory**: Storing conversation history
- **Memory Chains**: Combining chains with memory components
- **Context Management**: Maintaining state across multiple interactions
- **Multi-turn Conversations**: Handling follow-up questions and clarifications

## Prerequisites:
- Complete Example 2: Sequential Chains (especially the customer service example)
- Understanding of basic LangChain concepts
- OpenAI API key (same as previous examples)

## Building on Example 2:
This example takes the customer service workflow from Example 2 and adds:
1. **Conversation Memory**: Remembering previous interactions
2. **Context Awareness**: Understanding references to past conversations
3. **Follow-up Handling**: Managing multi-turn customer inquiries
4. **State Management**: Maintaining customer context throughout the session

## Key Improvements:
- **Persistent Context**: Customer doesn't need to repeat information
- **Intelligent Responses**: Responses consider conversation history
- **Better UX**: More natural, contextual conversations
- **Efficiency**: Reduced need for customer to re-explain issues

## Next examples will introduce:
- Tools for external API integration
- Agents for autonomous decision-making
- LangGraph for complex workflow orchestration
