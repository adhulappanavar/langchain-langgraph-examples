# Emotion Analysis in Customer Service Cases

## üéØ Current Output Analysis

Looking at the customer service example output, I can see that the Pydantic parsing is not working correctly - the LLM is returning the schema definition instead of actual parsed data. Let me analyze what emotions should be detected in each case and then provide a fix.

## üìä Expected vs Actual Emotion Detection

### Case 1: Password Reset Issue
**Customer Message**: "I've been trying to reset my password for 2 hours and nothing works! This is ridiculous!"

**Expected Emotion Analysis**:
- **Primary Emotion**: Frustrated/Angry
- **Intensity**: High
- **Indicators**: 
  - "2 hours" (time investment)
  - "nothing works" (repeated failure)
  - "This is ridiculous!" (exclamation, strong language)
  - Multiple exclamation marks

**Current Output**: ‚ùå Schema definition instead of parsed data

### Case 2: Plan Upgrade Inquiry
**Customer Message**: "Hi, I'm interested in upgrading my plan. Can you tell me about the premium features?"

**Expected Emotion Analysis**:
- **Primary Emotion**: Interested/Curious
- **Intensity**: Low to Medium
- **Indicators**:
  - "Hi" (polite greeting)
  - "interested" (positive intent)
  - "Can you tell me" (requesting information)
  - No urgency indicators

**Current Output**: ‚ùå Schema definition instead of parsed data

### Case 3: Billing Issue
**Customer Message**: "My bill this month is $200 more than usual. I don't understand why it's so high."

**Expected Emotion Analysis**:
- **Primary Emotion**: Confused/Concerned
- **Intensity**: Medium
- **Indicators**:
  - "$200 more" (significant increase)
  - "I don't understand" (confusion)
  - "why it's so high" (seeking explanation)
  - No anger indicators

**Current Output**: ‚úÖ Correctly parsed - "Confused"

### Case 4: App Crashing Issue
**Customer Message**: "The app keeps crashing every time I try to upload a file. I have a deadline tomorrow!"

**Expected Emotion Analysis**:
- **Primary Emotion**: Frustrated/Stressed
- **Intensity**: High
- **Indicators**:
  - "keeps crashing" (repeated failure)
  - "every time" (consistent problem)
  - "deadline tomorrow!" (time pressure)
  - Exclamation mark

**Current Output**: ‚ùå Schema definition instead of parsed data

### Case 5: Positive Feedback
**Customer Message**: "Thanks for the great service! I wanted to let you know how much I appreciate your help."

**Expected Emotion Analysis**:
- **Primary Emotion**: Happy/Grateful
- **Intensity**: Medium to High
- **Indicators**:
  - "Thanks" (gratitude)
  - "great service" (positive feedback)
  - "appreciate" (strong positive emotion)
  - Exclamation mark

**Current Output**: ‚úÖ Correctly parsed - "Happy"

## üîç Issues Identified

### 1. **Pydantic Parsing Problems**
The LLM is returning the schema definition instead of actual data for most cases. This suggests:
- The format instructions might be too complex
- The LLM might be confused about the expected output format
- Temperature settings might need adjustment

### 2. **Inconsistent Parsing**
Only 2 out of 5 cases (Cases 3 and 5) are correctly parsed, while the others return schema definitions.

### 3. **Emotion Detection Accuracy**
When parsing works correctly, the emotion detection is accurate:
- **Case 3**: "Confused" ‚úì (correct for billing inquiry)
- **Case 5**: "Happy" ‚úì (correct for positive feedback)

## üõ†Ô∏è Root Cause Analysis

### **Pydantic Parser Issues**
```python
# Current problematic approach
parser = PydanticOutputParser(pydantic_object=CustomerInquiry)
prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["customer_message"],
    template="Analyze the following customer inquiry...\n\n{format_instructions}",
    partial_variables={"format_instructions": parser.get_format_instructions()}
)
```

The `format_instructions` are too verbose and complex, causing the LLM to return the schema instead of actual data.

### **Expected vs Actual Output**
**Expected**:
```json
{
  "main_issue": "password reset failure",
  "customer_emotion": "frustrated",
  "urgency_level": "high",
  "context": ["been trying for 2 hours", "nothing works"]
}
```

**Actual** (for most cases):
```json
{
  "description": "Structure for understanding customer inquiry",
  "properties": {
    "main_issue": {
      "description": "The primary issue or question",
      "title": "Main Issue",
      "type": "string"
    },
    // ... schema definition instead of actual data
  }
}
```

## üéØ Emotion Detection Patterns

### **High Frustration Indicators**:
- Multiple exclamation marks
- Time references ("2 hours", "for days")
- Strong negative language ("ridiculous", "useless")
- Repeated failure mentions ("keeps crashing", "nothing works")

### **Medium Concern Indicators**:
- Questioning language ("I don't understand", "why is this")
- Significant changes ("$200 more", "unusual")
- Seeking explanations

### **Low/Positive Emotion Indicators**:
- Polite greetings ("Hi", "Hello")
- Positive intent words ("interested", "appreciate")
- Gratitude expressions ("Thanks", "thank you")

### **Urgency Indicators**:
- Time pressure ("deadline tomorrow", "meeting in 30 minutes")
- Immediate need language ("urgent", "asap")
- Exclamation marks

## üöÄ Recommended Fixes

### 1. **Simplify Pydantic Parsing**
```python
# Use a simpler approach with explicit examples
prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["customer_message"],
    template="""Analyze this customer message and return a JSON object:

Customer: {customer_message}

Return ONLY a JSON object like this:
{{
  "main_issue": "brief description of the main problem",
  "customer_emotion": "frustrated/happy/confused/angry/stressed",
  "urgency_level": "low/medium/high/critical",
  "context": ["key detail 1", "key detail 2"]
}}"""
)
```

### 2. **Add Emotion Detection Examples**
```python
# Provide clear examples for emotion detection
examples = """
Examples:
- "I'm frustrated with this service" ‚Üí "frustrated"
- "Thanks for your help!" ‚Üí "happy"
- "I don't understand why..." ‚Üí "confused"
- "This is ridiculous!" ‚Üí "angry"
- "I have a deadline tomorrow!" ‚Üí "stressed"
"""
```

### 3. **Adjust Temperature Settings**
- **Understanding Chain**: Increase from 0.2 to 0.3 for better parsing
- **Response Chain**: Keep at 0.7 for natural responses

This analysis shows that while the emotion detection logic is sound, the technical implementation needs improvement to ensure consistent parsing of the LLM outputs.
