# Example 5: LangGraph Basics

## What you'll learn:
- Creating complex workflows with state management
- Understanding nodes, edges, and state graphs
- Building multi-step processes with conditional logic
- Orchestrating tools and agents in structured workflows

## Concepts covered:
- **StateGraph**: The core LangGraph component for workflow orchestration
- **Nodes**: Individual processing steps in the workflow
- **Edges**: Connections between nodes that define workflow flow
- **State Management**: Tracking and updating application state
- **Conditional Logic**: Making decisions based on state

## Prerequisites:
- Complete Example 4: Tools and Agents
- Understanding of tools, agents, and memory
- OpenAI API key (same as previous examples)
- Basic understanding of graph theory concepts

## Building on Example 4:
This example takes the tools and agents from Example 4 and adds:
1. **Workflow Orchestration**: Structured multi-step processes
2. **State Management**: Tracking information across workflow steps
3. **Conditional Logic**: Making decisions based on workflow state
4. **Complex Routing**: Directing workflow based on conditions

## Key Improvements:
- **Structured Workflows**: Clear step-by-step processes
- **State Persistence**: Information maintained across steps
- **Conditional Execution**: Different paths based on conditions
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure and recovery
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple steps can run simultaneously

## Next examples will introduce:
- Advanced LangGraph for complex workflows
- Parallel execution and branching
- Real-world application with full integration
