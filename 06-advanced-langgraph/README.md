# Example 6: Advanced LangGraph

## What you'll learn:
- Building complex workflows with parallel execution
- Advanced state management and conditional logic
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Multi-agent systems and coordination
- Real-time decision making and dynamic routing

## Concepts covered:
- **Parallel Execution**: Running multiple nodes simultaneously
- **Advanced State Management**: Complex state tracking and persistence
- **Conditional Logic**: Sophisticated decision-making workflows
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure and recovery strategies
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Multiple agents working together
- **Dynamic Routing**: Runtime path determination

## Prerequisites:
- Complete Example 5: LangGraph Basics
- Understanding of state management and node functions
- OpenAI API key (same as previous examples)
- Familiarity with async programming concepts

## Building on Example 5:
This example takes the basic LangGraph concepts and adds:
1. **Parallel Execution**: Multiple nodes running simultaneously
2. **Advanced State Management**: Complex state tracking across workflows
3. **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery and fallback mechanisms
4. **Multi-Agent Systems**: Coordination between multiple specialized agents
5. **Dynamic Decision Making**: Runtime path determination based on state

## Key Improvements:
- **Performance**: Parallel execution for faster processing
- **Reliability**: Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- **Scalability**: Multi-agent coordination for complex tasks
- **Flexibility**: Dynamic routing based on runtime conditions
- **Robustness**: Graceful handling of failures and edge cases

## Advanced Features:
- **Parallel Nodes**: Multiple operations running simultaneously
- **Conditional Branches**: Complex decision trees
- **State Persistence**: Long-running workflow state management
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry and fallback mechanisms
- **Agent Coordination**: Multiple agents working together
- **Dynamic Routing**: Runtime path determination
