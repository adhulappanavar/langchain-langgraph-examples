# Example 4: Tools and Agents

## What you'll learn:
- Creating agents that can use external tools and APIs
- Building autonomous systems that make decisions
- Integrating external data sources and services
- Understanding agent reasoning and tool selection

## Concepts covered:
- **Agents**: Autonomous systems that can use tools
- **Tools**: External functions and APIs that agents can call
- **Agent Reasoning**: How agents decide which tools to use
- **Tool Integration**: Connecting external services to LangChain

## Prerequisites:
- Complete Example 3: Memory Chains
- Understanding of sequential chains and memory
- OpenAI API key (same as previous examples)
- Basic understanding of APIs and external services

## Building on Example 3:
This example takes the customer service workflow from Example 3 and adds:
1. **External Tools**: Weather API, calculator, search engine
2. **Agent Reasoning**: Autonomous decision-making about which tools to use
3. **Tool Integration**: Connecting real external services
4. **Enhanced Responses**: More accurate and helpful responses using external data

## Key Improvements:
- **Real-time Data**: Access to current information (weather, prices, etc.)
- **Calculations**: Mathematical operations and conversions
- **Search Capabilities**: Finding information from external sources
- **Autonomous Decisions**: Agents choose the best tools for each situation

## Next examples will introduce:
- LangGraph for complex workflow orchestration
- Advanced state management
- Complex branching and conditional logic
