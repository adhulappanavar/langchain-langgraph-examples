# Understanding Example 4: Tools and Agents

## What are Agents and Tools?

Agents are autonomous systems that can use external tools to accomplish tasks. They can reason about which tools to use, when to use them, and how to combine their results to provide comprehensive responses.

## Key Concepts in This Example

### 1. Tools
Tools are external functions or APIs that agents can call to get information or perform actions:

```python
class WeatherTool(BaseTool):
    name = "weather"
    description = "Get current weather information for a specific location"
    
    def _run(self, location: str) -> str:
        # Tool implementation
        return f"Weather in {location}: 22째C, Sunny, Humidity: 65%"
```

### 2. Agents
Agents are LLM-powered systems that can:
- **Reason**: Decide which tools to use
- **Plan**: Create a sequence of actions
- **Execute**: Use tools to get information
- **Synthesize**: Combine results into coherent responses

```python
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm,
    agent=AgentType.CONVERSATIONAL_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    memory=memory,
    verbose=True
)
```

### 3. Agent Types
- **CONVERSATIONAL_REACT_DESCRIPTION**: Best for chat-based interactions
- **ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION**: For single-turn tasks
- **STRUCTURED_CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION**: For structured conversations

## Building on the Customer Service Example

### Enhanced Customer Service with Tools
The customer service agent now has access to:
- **Weather Tool**: Check weather conditions for delivery delays
- **Calculator Tool**: Perform price calculations and tax computations
- **Search Tool**: Find information about policies and procedures
- **Customer Database Tool**: Look up customer information and order history

### Agent Reasoning Process
1. **Input Analysis**: Understand the customer's request
2. **Tool Selection**: Decide which tools are needed
3. **Tool Execution**: Call the appropriate tools
4. **Result Synthesis**: Combine tool results into a coherent response

## Code Breakdown

### Custom Tool Creation
```python
class WeatherTool(BaseTool):
    name = "weather"
    description = "Get current weather information for a specific location"
    
    def _run(self, location: str) -> str:
        # Simulate weather API call
        weather_data = {
            "location": location,
            "temperature": "22째C",
            "condition": "Sunny",
            "humidity": "65%",
            "wind": "10 km/h"
        }
        return f"Weather in {location}: {weather_data['temperature']}, {weather_data['condition']}"
```

**Key Components:**
- `name`: Unique identifier for the tool
- `description`: Tells the agent when to use this tool
- `_run()`: The actual tool implementation
- `_arun()`: Async version (optional)

### Agent Initialization
```python
def create_customer_service_agent():
    llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0.7)
    memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history", return_messages=True)
    
    tools = [
        WeatherTool(),
        CalculatorTool(),
        SearchTool(),
        CustomerDatabaseTool()
    ]
    
    return initialize_agent(
        tools=tools,
        llm=llm,
        agent=AgentType.CONVERSATIONAL_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
        memory=memory,
        verbose=True
    )
```

### Agent Execution
```python
# Agent automatically decides which tools to use
response = agent.invoke({"input": "Check weather in New York and calculate shipping costs"})
```

## What You've Learned

1. **Tool Creation**: How to create custom tools for specific tasks
2. **Agent Configuration**: How to set up agents with tools and memory
3. **Agent Reasoning**: How agents decide which tools to use
4. **Tool Integration**: How to combine multiple tools for complex tasks
5. **Specialized Agents**: How to create agents for specific use cases

## Advanced Agent Concepts

### Agent Reasoning Patterns
1. **Single Tool**: Simple requests that need one tool
2. **Multiple Tools**: Complex requests requiring multiple tools
3. **Sequential Reasoning**: Using tools in a specific order
4. **Conditional Reasoning**: Using tools based on conditions

### Tool Categories
1. **Information Tools**: Weather, search, database lookups
2. **Computation Tools**: Calculator, currency conversion
3. **Action Tools**: Email sending, file operations
4. **Integration Tools**: API calls, external services

## Real-World Applications

### Customer Service Benefits
1. **Real-time Information**: Access to current weather, prices, etc.
2. **Accurate Calculations**: Precise cost calculations with tax
3. **Comprehensive Responses**: Information from multiple sources
4. **Autonomous Operation**: Agents work independently

### Technical Benefits
1. **Modularity**: Tools can be developed and tested independently
2. **Scalability**: Easy to add new tools and capabilities
3. **Maintainability**: Tools can be updated without changing agents
4. **Flexibility**: Different agents can use different tool sets

## Agent vs Tool Comparison

### Without Tools (Previous Examples)
```
Customer: "What's the weather in New York?"
Assistant: "I don't have access to current weather information. You might want to check a weather website."
```

### With Tools (Example 4)
```
Customer: "What's the weather in New York?"
Assistant: "Let me check the current weather for you.
[Uses weather tool]
Weather in New York: 22째C, Sunny, Humidity: 65%, Wind: 10 km/h"
```

## Specialized Agents

### Sales Agent
- **Tools**: Calculator, Product Catalog, Search
- **Focus**: Pricing, product information, sales calculations
- **Use Case**: Product inquiries, pricing questions

### Support Agent
- **Tools**: Customer Database, System Status, Search
- **Focus**: Technical issues, customer information
- **Use Case**: Technical support, account issues

### General Agent
- **Tools**: Weather, Calculator, Search, Customer Database
- **Focus**: All types of customer inquiries
- **Use Case**: General customer service

## Agent Reasoning Examples

### Simple Reasoning
```
Input: "What's the weather in Chicago?"
Reasoning: "This is a weather-related question. I should use the weather tool."
Action: Use weather tool with "Chicago"
Result: "Weather in Chicago: 18째C, Cloudy, Humidity: 70%"
```

### Complex Reasoning
```
Input: "A customer in Miami wants to know delivery delays and calculate shipping costs"
Reasoning: "This requires weather information and calculations. I need both tools."
Action 1: Use weather tool with "Miami"
Action 2: Use calculator tool for shipping costs
Result: Combine both results into comprehensive response
```

## Best Practices

### Tool Design
1. **Clear Descriptions**: Help agents understand when to use tools
2. **Error Handling**: Graceful failure when tools don't work
3. **Input Validation**: Check inputs before processing
4. **Consistent Output**: Standardized response formats

### Agent Configuration
1. **Appropriate Agent Type**: Choose based on use case
2. **Memory Integration**: Include conversation history
3. **Verbose Mode**: Enable for debugging
4. **Error Handling**: Handle parsing errors gracefully

## Common Patterns

### Tool Selection
```python
# Agent automatically selects tools based on input
if "weather" in user_input:
    use_weather_tool()
if "calculate" in user_input:
    use_calculator_tool()
```

### Multi-tool Scenarios
```python
# Agent uses multiple tools for complex requests
def handle_complex_request(user_input):
    tools_needed = analyze_request(user_input)
    results = []
    for tool in tools_needed:
        result = tool.run()
        results.append(result)
    return synthesize_results(results)
```

### Specialized Agents
```python
# Different agents for different use cases
sales_agent = create_agent(sales_tools)
support_agent = create_agent(support_tools)
general_agent = create_agent(all_tools)
```

## Next Steps

In upcoming examples, you'll learn about:

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Tool Not Found**: Check tool names and descriptions
